# KeKe23333-Big-Data-Management_comp_9313
This is for KeKe23333/Big-Data-Management practices and some homework .

# Summary
This course introduces the core concepts and technologies involved in managing Big Data. It will first introduce the characteristics of big data and big data analysis. Then, we will learn the open-source big data management framework Hadoop. We will mainly focus on the learning of Hadoop MapReduce, and HDFS, HBase, and Hive will be briefly introduced. We will also learn an open-source memory-based distributed computing framework Spark. Another major focus of this course is algorithm design on large-scale data sets based on the big data management frameworks, in a variety of domains such as link analysis, data stream mining, graph data processing, and recommender systems.


# Course Aims
This course aims to introduce students to the concepts behind Big Data, the core technologies used in managing large-scale data sets, and a range of technologies for developing solutions to large-scale data analytics problems.

This course is intended for students who want to understand modern large-scale data analytics systems. It covers a wide range of topics and technologies and will prepare students to be able to build such systems as well as use them efficiently and effectively address challenges in big data management.

# Student Learning Outcomes
After completing this course, students will be able to:

describe the important characteristics of Big Data
develop an appropriate storage structure for a Big Data repository
utilize the map/reduce paradigm and the Spark platform to manipulate Big Data
use a high-level query language to manipulate Big Data
develop efficient solutions for analytical problems involving Big Data
